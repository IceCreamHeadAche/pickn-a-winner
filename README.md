# pickn-a-winner
Select 'winners' from a list using random.choice - beginner project 

I decided I needed to learn how to program. I've worked on the Operations side of IT for 16 years and havn't bothered to program anything since college. Python was recommended as a good first choice, so here I am about 2 days into my project. I had promissed my 11 year old son that I would learn to program in 2015 so I could help him in 2016. He wants to be a pen tester when he grows up.
